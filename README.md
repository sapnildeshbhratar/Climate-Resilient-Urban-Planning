# Climate-Resilient-Urban-Planning
Developed a C application to analyze urban heat metrics of a city(degree days, heat island intensity) and thermal comfort
indices via custom algorithms. Streamlined data processing of temperature, vegetation, and population density 
using priority queues and dynamic arrays.
